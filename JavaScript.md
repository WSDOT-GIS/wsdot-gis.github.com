JavaScript and Web Development
==============================


Tools
-----

[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Runs JavaScript outside of a web browser.

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - *TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.*


### IDE

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - This is a good tool to use when the full Visual Studio would be overkill. (E.g., web applications with no server-side code.)

### Package managers ###

[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - comes with Node.

* [npm-windows-upgrade](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/npm-windows-upgrade) - Use this tool to upgrade NPM to the latest version on Windows systems.

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) - alternative to NPM that caches packages in order to make fewer web requests when acquiring dependencies.

[lerna](https://lernajs.io/) - Manages multiple interdependent projects in a single source code repository.
